# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  2 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  I get to experiment with Formatador gem, which was really fun
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  + Feature 1: Users will be able to change the priority of a todo item
  Because sometimes things change unexpectedly and you have to change the
  priority of things you work on

  + Feature 2: Users will be able to print out the list of items nicely
  Users want to see data displayed nicely
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  Adding more item types to the list.
  Experimenting with more suggested Ruby gems.
