# What you added to Udacitask 2.0
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. What is the gem of your choice and how did you use it?
  The gem of my choice is formatador
  I used it to print the list title in the "all" medthod of Udacilist
2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) Feature 1
    - Users will be able to find what is the earliest upcoming events in their schedule
    If the start_date of the event is nil, then we consider the event has not been
    scheduled yet. We only compare events with start_date given.
    - "earliest_upcoming_event" method was implemented in udacilist.rb
  b) Feature 2
    Users will be able to print out the list of items nicely
    in a table using Formatador gemt
    "pretty_print" method was implemented in udacilist.rb
    This feature is can be considered as "Using your third gem in an interesting way"

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  2 hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  I get to experiment with Formatador gem, which was really fun
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  + Feature 1: Users will be able to change the priority of a todo item
  Because sometimes things change unexpectedly and you have to change the
  priority of things you work on

  + Feature 2: Users will be able to print out the list of items nicely
  Users want to see data displayed nicely
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  Adding more item types to the list.
  Experimenting with more suggested Ruby gems.
